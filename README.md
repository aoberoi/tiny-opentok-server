# Tiny OpenTok Server

Just a little node server for getting things done.

## Running

Define the required environment variables in a file named `.env` at the root of the project. Then
start the server process with `npm start` at the command line.

A public URL is generated for the running server using a tunnelled connection to the local server.
This can be useful for interacting with devices not on your wifi network (local NAT). The URL is
logged to stdout (console).

Required environment variables:
  *  `OPENTOK_KEY`: An OpenTok API Key
  *  `OPENTOK_SECRET`: The API Secret for the given key

Optional environment variables:
  *  `PORT`: The port on which the server will listen (default: 5000)
  *  `TUNNEL_SUBDOMAIN`: Preferred subdomain for the public URL tunnelled to the local server.
  alphanumeric string of length (4,20) (default: randomly assigned)
